**LaTeX Dissertation Template - Materials Science and Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University**

A LaTeX template for PhD dissertations that conforms to the MSE (Materials Science & Engineering) department's requirements at Carnegie Mellon University.

This is a template for a CMU MSE dissertation/thesis overview.  This template was modified from cmuthesis.cls, published by David Koes (www.cs.cmu.edu/~dkoes), and subsequently modified by Raja Sambasivan to conform to ECE standards.  This version is forked from an updated version by [Ryan Cohn](https://github.com/rccohn), which was changed to conform to MSE standards first, and updated again by [Charles Evans](https://github.com/realitychemist) by implementing additional requirements of [engineering standars](https://engineering.cmu.edu/education/academic-policies/graduate-policies/thesis-dissertation.html) as of 2021. Please see [that repository](https://github.com/realitychemist/cmu_mse_dissertation_template) for more information about the document history.
